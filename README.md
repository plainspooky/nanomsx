A GNU nano-like text editor for MSX 2.
It is based on [Qed-Pascal](http://texteditors.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=browse&diff=1&id=Qed-Pascal), and our main approach is to have almost all useful GNU nano funcionalities.
## Command-line parameters
 - /h 		- Show command line help.
 - /v 		- Show nanoMSX version.
 - /la          - Start at line a.
 - /cb          - Start at column b.
 - /tn          - Make a tab this number (n) of columns wide.
